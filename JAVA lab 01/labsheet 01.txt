1. Real-world objects contain attributes and behaviours.
2. A software object's state is stored in instance variables.
3. A software object's behaviour is exposed through methods.
4. Hiding internal data from the outside world and accessing it only through 
publicly exposed methods is known as data encapsulation.
5. A blueprint for a software object is called a class.
6. Common behaviour can be defined in a superclass and inherited into a 
subclass using the extends keyword.
7. A collection of methods with no implementation is called an interface.
8. A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces by functionality is called a 
package.
9. The term API stands for Application Programming Interface.
